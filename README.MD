# Hume’s Dictum, Grounding and the Argument from Recombination

This repository contains the paper **"Hume’s Dictum, Grounding and the Argument from Recombination"** by **Alexander Skiles**. The paper explores the tension between Hume's Dictum—the idea that there are no necessary connections between wholly distinct existents—and the metaphysical notion of grounding. It examines how the argument from recombination poses challenges to grounding-based metaphysical theories.

## 🧠 Overview

- **Hume’s Dictum (HD):** There are no necessary connections between wholly distinct existents.
- **Grounding:** A metaphysical relation where one fact or entity holds *in virtue of* another.
- **Argument from Recombination:** The idea that any distinct entities can be freely recombined in possible worlds.

The central question: _Can grounding relations be reconciled with Hume’s Dictum, or do they undermine its core principle?_

## 📚 Abstract

Grounding is often thought to create necessary connections between entities. If such connections violate Hume's Dictum, then common assumptions in grounding theory may need revision. The paper analyzes this conflict and considers possible resolutions, including redefining distinctness, altering grounding's modal profile, or limiting Hume’s Dictum's scope.

## 💬 Usage

This repository is intended for:

- Students and scholars of metaphysics
- Philosophers interested in modal logic, dependence, and grounding
- Readers analyzing the limits of recombination arguments
